======================================================
 Python implementation of the multihash specification
======================================================

This is an implementation of the `multihash`_ specification in Python.
The main component in the module is the `Multihash` class, a named tuple that
represents a hash function and a digest created with it, with extended
abilities to work with hashlib-compatible hash functions, verify the integrity
of data, and encode itself to a byte string in the binary format described in
the specification (possibly ASCII-encoded).  The `decode()` function can be
used for the inverse operation, i.e. converting a (possibly ASCII-encoded)
byte string into a `Multihash` object.

For more information, please see the documentation under the ``docs``
directory and the docstrings in the ``multihash`` package.  Ready-to-read
documentation is also available in https://pymultihash.readthedocs.io/.

This package requires at least Python 3.4.
